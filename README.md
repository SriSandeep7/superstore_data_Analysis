Super Store Data Analysis using Python with NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib
This repository contains a Python data analysis project that focuses on analyzing and visualizing the data of a super store using popular data manipulation libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib. The project also involves data cleaning to ensure the data is accurate and ready for analysis.
Introduction:
The goal of this project is to analyze the sales and performance of a super store by examining its historical data. We will use Python's data manipulation and visualization libraries to gain insights into the store's operations, identify trends, and make data-driven decisions.
Installation
To run the code in this repository, you need to have Python and the following libraries installed:
NumPy
Pandas
Matplotlib
The Super Store Data Analysis project using Python, NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib aims to provide valuable insights into the performance of a super store. Through data cleaning and visualization, we can gain a deeper understanding of the store's operations and make informed business decisions.

Feel free to explore the code in this repository and adapt it for your own data analysis projects. Happy coding!
